# An HTML-based presentation template.

This responsive presentation template is based on the principles outlined in Edward Tufte's course on [presenting data and information](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses):

* Presenting all the information to the audience at one time, so that they can read and absorb it at their own pace
* Optimizing it for use on phones and tablets
* More transparently citing research sources
